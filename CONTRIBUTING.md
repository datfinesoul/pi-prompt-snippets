# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to pi-prompt-snippets.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues and pull requests before opening a new one.
- Open an issue before making a substantial behavioral or architectural change.
- Report security issues according to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not in a public issue.
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all project spaces.

## Development setup

Requirements:

- Node.js 22.19 or newer, matching Pi's minimum supported version
- A current Pi installation for extension smoke testing

Clone the repository and run the tests:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/datfinesoul/pi-prompt-snippets.git
cd pi-prompt-snippets
npm test
```

No dependency installation or build step is required. To load the working tree without enabling other extensions, run:

```sh
pi --no-extensions --extension ./extensions/prompt-snippets/index.ts
```

## Making changes

1. Create a focused branch from `main`.
2. Add or update tests for behavior changes.
3. Keep the extension dependency-free unless a dependency provides clear value that cannot reasonably be implemented with the Node.js standard library.
4. Update the README and changelog when user-visible behavior changes.
5. Run `npm test` and `npm run pack:check`.

## Pull requests

Pull requests should explain the problem, the chosen solution, testing performed, and any compatibility implications. Keep changes focused and avoid unrelated formatting or refactoring. By submitting a contribution, you agree that it is licensed under the repository's [MIT License](LICENSE).
